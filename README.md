I have created and coded an app called weatherApp, which displays the days of the week, minimum temperature, maximum temperature and what the weather conditions will be like. This weather app has been created by a local weather organisation. 
It also displays the average of the weekly temperature. Please note: I mistakely submitted and used up my one submission right on BrighstSpace and I have included my slides as images.
I used an online background image and I edited the image and my weather app logo on Canva. The image that I used for my background is a blue and yellow gradient and I chose this as my app background because it goes well with the weather theme. 

GitHub and GitHub Actions:
GitHub is a developer platform that allows developers to create, store and share their code. GitHub is used for version control as well as collaboration in software development projects. GitHub Actions is a feature that enables automatic workflows within the repositories. These workflows allow developers to automate various tasks, such as building and testing. In order to create a repository, you have to first sign into GitHub, then click on ‘Your repository or new.’  Then, add a repository name. The name of your repository should be the name of your Android app. Ensure that the repository is on public and not private. Then, click the green box at the bottom that says, ‘Create repository.’ 

‘Pushing’ a file to GitHub means that you’re uploading a local repository to a remote repository. When you’re doing this, you have to ensure that all of your changes to the local repository are committed. When you commit in GitHub, you create a snapshot of the changes you made in your local repository.

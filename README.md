I have created and coded an app called weatherApp, which displays the days of the week, minimum temperature, maximum temperature and what the weather conditions will be like. This weather app has been created by a local weather organisation. 
It also displays the average of the weekly temperature. Please note: I mistakely submiited and used up my one submission right on BrighstSpace and I have included my slides as images.
